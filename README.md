# JSMin
Java Minifier of Javascript files (Beta Version)

This is a quite improved Java version of Douglas Crockford's JSMin. According to him, "JSMin is a filter that omits or modifies some characters. This does not change the behavior of the program that it is minifying. The result may be harder to debug. It will definitely be harder to read."

Requirements: JDK 7 or higher

Examples:

java -cp . JSMin youroriginfile.js ISO-8859-1

java -cp . JSMin youroriginfile.js UTF-8
